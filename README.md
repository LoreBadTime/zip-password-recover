# Xda funny Disclamer
* I'm not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed (like it did for me...).
* YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.
* Your warranty will be void if you tamper with any part of your device / software
* The software should be used only to recover lost passwords of important files, not to crack others archieves without permission

# Disclamer
*The program that is licensed to you is absolutely legal and you can use it provided that you are the legal owner of all files or data you are going  to recover through the use of our software or have permission from the legitimate owner to perform these acts. Any illegal use of our software will be solely  your responsibility. Accordingly, you affirm that you have the legal right to access all data, information and files that have been hidden.

*You further attest that the recovered data, passwords and/or files will not be used for any illegal purpose. Be aware password recovery and the subsequencial data decryption of unauthorized or otherwise illegally obtained files may constitute theft or another wrongful action and may result in your civil and (or) criminal prosecution.

# Real propuse of the program
This is just a test for a file integrity check,however if you just want the normal program there are no problems executing it(only an advice of impossible check) 

# Requirements:
* Python installed (tested on 3.9)
* Nothing ,it will provide a direct download for 7zip file manager(used by the program to recover the passwords),no problems if you have it already installed(tested on 7zip 21,02 alpha)


# normal use
* Download and Extract the Zip file from source zip and run "Zip Password Recover.pyw"
* I think ui its pretty self-explanatory
