# Zip-Password-Recover
Simple zip archieve password recover software,(could work even with rar or 7z) 

#DISCLAMER
* I'm not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed (like it did for me...).
* YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.
* Your warranty will be void if you tamper with any part of your device / software

# Real propuse of the program
This is just a test for a ipfs file executable integrity check,however if you just want the normal program there are no problems executing it(only an advice of impossible check) 

# Requirements:
* Python installed (tested on 3.9)
* Nothing if you want to just use the recovery program,it will provide a direct download for 7zip file manager(used by the program to recover the passwords),no problems if you have it already installed(tested on 7zip 21,02 alpha)
 
# Requirements for ipfs checking 
* Ipfs protocol fully installed on your pc and activated during execution
* ipfshttpclient installed as python library (i have included scripts for installing it rapidly)
* Rename the executable into "Zip Password Recover.pyw",(the program checks even this)

# normal use
I think ui its pretty self-explanatory

# file check test:
* Activate ipfs protocol (tested on IPFS desktop)
* Be sure you have the executable named exactly with "Zip Password Recover.pyw"
* start the program

If check doesnt happens then you will find open this window
